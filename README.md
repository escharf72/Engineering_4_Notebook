## Get Your Pi Online ##
**Description:** The goal of this assignment was to get your pi connected to the internet and then use that connection to send some code to github. 
**Reflection:** This assignment took me a very long time, as I kept running into issue after issue. My takeaway from the work on this assignment is that there is always more than one way to do something, so if the common/easy way doesn't work, look to see how you can work around it, and when in doubt, go as close to the heart of the issue as possible.
