## Get Your Pi Online ##
**Description:** The goal of this assignment was to get your pi connected to the internet and then use that connection to send some code to github. 

**Reflection:** This assignment took me a very long time, as I kept running into issue after issue. My takeaway from the work on this assignment is that there is always more than one way to do something, so if the common/easy way doesn't work, look to see how you can work around it, and when in doubt, go as close to the heart of the issue as possible. 

## Hello Python ##
**Description:** The goal of this assignment was simply to create a system that would roll a die (provide a random number from 1-6) when the enter key was pressed and exit the program when x and enter were pressed. 

**Reflection:** This program ended up being very simple-less than 15 lines of code-but it took a while to figure out the correct syntax and logic to make it run properly. I learned that it is super helpful to take a break every so often and just talk yourself through the code. There were times were I was so frustrated because the code didn't seem to be working properly and I would read through it and realize that the logic was out of order. I get caught up in syntax and forget to zoom out a bit and make sure my process is correct. I will be using this process with future code before jumping into syntaxland.

# Automatic Dice Roller
# Written by Elisabeth Scharf 
from random import randint 
#including this library gave me access to the functions that provided the random number for the dice roll 
import time

print ("Automatic Dice Roller") 
#Using the print function makes it easier to troubleshoot code and more straightforward for the user 

while(True):
  time.sleep(.25) #Just so the loop isn't running too fast
 
  text = input("Press enter to roll or x and enter to exit") #This establishes instructions for the input that I will check for later in the code 

  if text == (""): #The quotes indicate the user pressing the enter key on the keyboard
    print(randint(1,6))

  if text == ("x"): 
    exit() 
    
 ``` 
 
 ## Calculator ##
 **Description:** Create a program that find the sum, difference, product, quotient, and modulo of two numbers entered by the user. The two numbers will go through one function five times and print the proper numbers. 
 
 **Reflection:** Troubleshooting is a universally helpful skill. This code required a lot of troubleshooting and simplifying to make sure that we weren't tackling too many variables at the same time. Printing is the best way to get feedback and figure out where the disconnect is within the code and simplifying (commenting out) your code can help you isolate the issue. Learning these skills on simpler and shorter codes will serve us well in the future when we encounter problems in our code.

num = 1 #num is a simple variable that we use to determine when the calculator cycle has run its course and it is time to prompt the user for more numbers

#this is the aptly named doMath function. We send it three values that it needs in order to perform its tasks: the two numbers and a number corresponding to the opperation it is supposed to perform 
def doMath(a,b,c):   
  int1 = int(a)
  int2 = int(b)

  ## Quadratic Solver ##
  **Description:** Create a program that prints the roots of a quadratic equation whose coefficients are entered by a user. (If there are no roots it will print none)
  
  **Reflection:** Math concepts can actually be helpful outside of math class. ;) Again, splitting a task into smaller steps is the way to go, especially when layers of math could potenetially obscure the issue, making it hard to know what to fix. By startin small and layering on various aspects, you have a much more straightforward troubleshooting process because you aren't dealing with too many variables at one time. Pseudocoding is a great way to break it down into small steps and not get lost in or confused by the jargon. You take each step in bite-sized pieces and are able to do specific research if you don't know the jargon but do know the logic behind the task.

  intA = int(a)

  disc = ((intB*intB)-(4*intA*intC))  #Disc stands for discriminant

## Strings and Loops ## 
**Description:** Take a simple sentence and print it in a vertical orientation wtih dashes in place of spaces

**Reflection:** This code ended up being fairly simple and short, but there was a lot of research and learning that went on behind it. Length of code does not necessarily determine complexity. I learned that I need to do some more research and practice more with lists and arrays in order to be able to use them in my own projects-I see the practicality of arrays but still struggle to understand quite how to use them and make them work in a variety of contexts.

#Strings and Loops
#Written by Abby Paquette and Elisabeth Scharf

# This is the library that allows us to use arrays, which are much more efficient in storing large amounts of information than lists are
# Also I learned that you can import a library as a different word which helps keep the code clean and readable
import numpy as np 

txt = input("Type a simple sentence: ") #Prompting the user... 

letters = list(txt) # input to list 


array1 = np.array(letters) # list to array

for i in letters:
    newStr = i.replace(' ', '-') #replacing the spaces with - 
    print(newStr) #printing the modified sequence
    
``` 

## Hangman (Or Man-Shaped Pi√±ata) ##
**Description:** Design a program that allows two users to play hangman. 

**Reflection:** This was quite a project, but it was a fun goal to work towards. This code is an excellent example of the necessity of planning and pseudocoding before sitting down to code.
This code taught me many lessons:
1. Pseudocode first and split the code into small tasks:

We did our best to split the task into small, acheivable steps (see below). This made troubleshooting easier and (maybe more importantly) kept us motivated with small victories rather than wading through a chunk of error-filled code. You can't make a tower of blocks all at once-you have to add one block at a time and make sure that each is stacked properly so it can support the ones that will be on top of it. 

2. Coding is 10% skill, 50% logic, and 40% motivation/mindset

In my years of taking engineering I have never really enjoyed the coding aspect of the class. I'm not naturally a very logical person so it requires more work for me to think through the process. But while working on the coding assignements this year, I have realized that a mindset shift is really what I need in order to begin to grow in my coding skills. I may not be the most logical person in the world, but coding helps me to build my logical reasoning and in turn the logical reasoning skills will make me a better coder. (A cycles of increasing benefits!) This assignment also taught me that I enjoy the process a lot more if I approach it as a challenge or a game that I want to do my best on. 

3. Collaborative coding is the way to go (when possible)

For this assignment I worked with a classmate and though we were occasionally treading on eachothers' toes and trying to run the code at the same time, the benefits of this collaboration made the inconveniences worth it. We were able to provide each other with motivation when the other was feeling frustrated, be a second pair of eyes to catch mistakes in the code, and be another person with whom they could verbally process the logic of a piece of code they were writing. Sometimes, if we were fed up with the specific task we were working on, we would switch assignments in order to 1. be a fresh pair of eyes on the task and 2. not go crazy or do more damage.

4.Google is your friend

I know I say this in nearly every reflection, but it is very true. There are so, so, so, so many resources out there and there is a 99% chance that someone else has experienced the same problem (or a similar problem) before. Collaboration is a crucial part of engineering- we aren't meant to create in bubble. Google is an excellent resource, especially when in-person collaboration and contact is harder.

**Pseudocode & Planning**
```
Ok, so the small tasks:
1. Player 1 gives the word and then the screen clears
  os.system(clear) Apparently this clears the screen
  We'll probably use an input just like normal 

2. Prompt player 2 to guess a letter
  Again I think just input
  Maybe we add a "Nope!" or a "Good Job!" in as a response
  The validation/response could be part of early step 3

3. It figures out whether the letter is in the word or not
  Do we need to turn the original word input into a list, str, array, or other? (probably array because it is heavily based on position in the word?)
  It also has to recognize if it's in the word more than once
4. Find the length of the word and turn it into spaces
  Wasn't there a function for that? Yeah I think there was, maybe i? yeah, and len(i) or something like that
  Should we do this at the beginning and just store it as an array or something like that to make it easier later? Maybe yeah, I think info gathering at the start is always good

5. Fill in those spaces with the correct guesses
  It seems like we'll really need to figure out how to use arrays to access positions of values stored in the array

6. If it's incorrect, print a message and add to the image
  Sub-task: how to draw the image
  Should we make a function for this?

7. Guess counter? 
  Should we have something that keeps track of player 2's guesses (This could be one of those var = var-1 in the loop or something like that)

8. Exit if guesses = 0 OR player 2 guesses the word 

Anything else we should include in the pseudocode?
This will be a good thing to put in github 

Notes: 
  Arrays can do math, lists can't
  [square brackets create a list]
  array.sort()
  list.sort()
  for i,j in enumerate(myList):
    print(i, end_"  --  ")
    print(j)

  pop-takes off the last
  apend - add one 
  print(myList[2]) (this will print just the third element) 
```

    while val4 > 1 and val4 != point: #If there is more that one instance of the guessed letter and it is in the word, do this:
      spaces[pos[point]] = cue2  # cue2 is an array that replaces a space in the spaces array with pos (the guess) in the first location (position 0 of the pos array is                                   the first number that shows the position of the guess in the secret array, which lines up with the spaces array)

It then repeats because val4 isn't 1. If val4 is more than 2 numbers long, then it                                      will repeat again. It goes until there aren't any numbers left in the val4 array.
