## Get Your Pi Online ##
**Description:** The goal of this assignment was to get your pi connected to the internet and then use that connection to send some code to github. 

**Reflection:** This assignment took me a very long time, as I kept running into issue after issue. My takeaway from the work on this assignment is that there is always more than one way to do something, so if the common/easy way doesn't work, look to see how you can work around it, and when in doubt, go as close to the heart of the issue as possible. 

## Hello Python ##
**Description:** The goal of this assignment was simply to create a system that would roll a die (provide a random number from 1-6) when the enter key was pressed and exit the program when x and enter were pressed. 

**Reflection:** This program ended up being very simple-less than 15 lines of code-but it took a while to figure out the correct syntax and logic to make it run properly. I learned that it is super helpful to take a break every so often and just talk yourself through the code. There were times were I was so frustrated because the code didn't seem to be working properly and I would read through it and realize that the logic was out of order. I get caught up in syntax and forget to zoom out a bit and make sure my process is correct. I will be using this process with future code before jumping into syntaxland.

# Automatic Dice Roller
# Written by Elisabeth Scharf 
from random import randint 
#including this library gave me access to the functions that provided the random number for the dice roll 
import time

print ("Automatic Dice Roller") 
#Using the print function makes it easier to troubleshoot code and more straightforward for the user 

while(True):
  time.sleep(.25) #Just so the loop isn't running too fast
 
  text = input("Press enter to roll or x and enter to exit") #This establishes instructions for the input that I will check for later in the code 

  if text == (""): #The quotes indicate the user pressing the enter key on the keyboard
    print(randint(1,6))

  if text == ("x"): 
    exit()
